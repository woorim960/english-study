# 답변

Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about household chores.

I usually do household chores on the weekend because I’m very busy working.

There are several things I do.

First of all, I do the dishes.

It’s very easy.

It takes only 10 minutes.

Second, I do the laundry.

There are a lot of clothes to be cleaned.

So, I use a laundry machine.

Lastly, I clean my room with my sister.

I always use a vacuum cleaner.

It’s very convenient and useful.

This is about my household chores.
