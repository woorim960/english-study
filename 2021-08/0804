I’d like to talk about some of the parks that you go to as you indicated in the survey.

Describe the parks that you like to go.

What do they look like in the summer and in the winter?


답변

Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about the park.

I usually go to Olympic park in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It take only 10 minutes to get there.

There are several things I can see.

First of all, many people enjoy playing sports in summer.

They like to play badminton and soccer.

I love spending time with my family, too.

It’s very fun and exciting.

(and...)

Second, there are no people at the park in winter.

It’s very cold and freezing.

When it snows, the streets are covered with snow.

It’s very beautiful.

Also, there is jogging track.

I go jogging and running.

It’s good for my health.

Plus, it relieves my stress.

Anyways, this is about the park in summer and winter.
