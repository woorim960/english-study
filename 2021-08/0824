Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my last vacation at home.

I did several things when I spent my vacation at home.

First of all, I cooked for my family.

I cooked cream pasta.

I prepared some ingredients such as noodle, cream sauce and vegetables.

It was very delicious.

My family really loved it.

Second, I did some household chores.

I washed(=did) the dishes.

It was very easy.

Also, I did the laundry.

There were a lot of clothes to be cleaned.

Therefore, I used a laundry machine.

It was very convenient and useful.

Lastly, I went to a park called the Olympic Park in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

I went jogging and running.

Jogging is good for my health.

This is about my last vacation at home.
