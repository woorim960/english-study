Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my cooking.

The question you asked me, I’m sorry but I have no experience.

I’m really good at cooking.

So, if you don’t mind, I wanna talk about my cooking experience.

Last weekend, I cooked Italian food for my family.

Cooking is my favorite hobby.

I cooked cream pasta.

It was very easy to make it.

Also, it was very delicious.

I’m interested in cooking because my family really loves it.

Making cream pasta was very simple.

I prepared noddle, cream sauce and some vegetables.

After that, I cooked cream pasta with these ingredients.

I love cooking.

It was very fun and exciting.

If I have a chance, I wanna make it for you.

This is all about my cooking experience.
