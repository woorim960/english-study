Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my gym.

There is a gym called Zest Gym in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

I usually go there on the weekend.

There are several things I do.

As soon as I arrive at my gym, I stretch out my body.

Warming up is very important.

After that, I start working out.

There are many different kinds of machines such as treadmill and stationary bicycles.

My favorite machine is treadmill.

I like jogging because it is good for my health.

Last thing I do is taking a shower.

I usually take 15 minutes for taking a shower.

When I have some time, I do sauna after working out.

I like it very much because it relieves my stress.

This is all I can say about my exercise at the gym.
