Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my vacation at home.

I like to go on a trip(=travle) during my vacation.

However, I need to take a rest when I get stressed from work.

Therefore, I prefer to stay home for vacation.

What I like the most is watching movies with my family.

I usually download the movies from the Internet.

Recently, we watched Harry Potter.

It was very fun and exciting.

Internet is so useful because I can download the movies instantly.

It’s very convenient and useful.

Also, it costs only 5 dollars.

If I have a chance, I wanna watch it again.

This is about what I do during my vacation.
