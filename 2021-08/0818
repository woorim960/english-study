Hello, Eva. This is woorim park.

How’s everything?

I heard that you also like to cook just like I do.

So, I have a few questions about cooking.

Do you mind?

First of all, what kind of food do you like?

In my case, I like Italian food the most.

And... When do you usually cook?

I usually cook on the weekend because I’m very busy working.

What else... Oh!

Where do you usually buy ingredients?

I go to a department store called the Galleria in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

Lastly, I have one more question.

What is your favorite Italian food?

My favorite Italian food is cream pasta.

It’s very delicious.

Thank you very much.

I’m happy to get to know you.
