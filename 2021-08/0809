Wow, this is a very interesting question.

I’d like to talk about my memorable jogging experience.

I usually go to the park called Olympic Park in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

Last weekend, I went to the park for jogging with my friends.

There is a jogging track at the park.

I like to go jogging and running.

It’s good for my health.

Also, it relieves my stress.

We enjoyed it together.

While I was jogging at the park,

I met my ex-girlfriend.

so, I was stunned and surprised because she was my first love.

She was looking good.

We noticed each other and smiled, I hope she’ll be happy.

I can’t forget the day.

This is about my memorable experience regarding jogging.
