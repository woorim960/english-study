1. Tell me about the responsibilities you took when you were a child.

What was expected of you?

I’d also like to know how they differ from what you are required to do these days.

Tell me in as much detail as possible.

Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my responsibilities when I was young.

I did simple chores when I was a child.

At that time, I just wanted to help my parents.

There were several things I did at home.

First of all, I did the dishes.

It was very easy.

It took only 10 minutes.

Second, I did the laundry.

There were a lot of clothes to be cleaned.

So, I used a laundry machine.

Lastly, I cleaned my room with my sister.

I always used a vacuum cleaner.

It was very convenient and useful.

This is about my responsibilities when I was young.
