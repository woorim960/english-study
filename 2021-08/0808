Hello, Eva. This is woorim park.

How’s everything?

I heard that you also like to go jogging just like I do.

So, I have a few questions about jogging.

Do you mind?

First of all, what kind of exercise do you like?

In my case, I like jogging the most.

And... When do you usually go for jogging?

I usually go for jogging on the weekend because I’m very busy working.

What else... Oh!

Where do you go jogging?

I go to the park called Olympic park in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

Lastly, I have one more question.

What do you usually wear when jogging?

I wear tracksuit and running shoes.

These are very comfortable while jogging.

Thank you very much.

I’m happy to get to know you.

Bye~
