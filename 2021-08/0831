Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about a sporting event.

I love watching soccer game.

I like to play soccer but I’m not that good.

So, I usually go to a stadium to watch soccer game on the weekend.

Last weekend, I went to a stadium called 상암 Stadium in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

I went there with my friends.

We enjoyed it together.

It was very fun and exciting.

My favorite soccer player is 손흥민.

So, I’m a big fan of 토트넘.

토트넘 won the game!

I was so happy.

I can’t forget the day.

If I have a chance, I wanna watch it again.

This is all about a sporting event I’ve been to.
