Tell me what adults and children do together at the parks you often go to.


답변

Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about the park.

I usually go to Olympic park in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It take only 10 minutes to get there.

There are several things people do.

First of all, adults go jogging and running.

There is a jogging track at the park.

They like jogging and running for health.

Second, children play sports.

They like to play badminton.

It looks very fun and exciting.

When I was young, I loved spending time with my friends.

In my case, I like going to the park on the weekend.

Anyways, this is about what adults and children do at the park.
