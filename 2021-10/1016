Today, I did the presentation for 10 minutes so simply in front of mentors after preparing the PPT reference for investment attraction briefing.
I was advised how to get the many investment, and intellectual property.
After everything was over,  our team started to discuss how to do the development of our project, and we started to develop the project.

I have a lot of experience in web development, but app development was a somewhat unfamiliar field, so there were many difficulties.
I have developed the Android app before. Also, 4 years ago, I have been a leader who developed the iPhone of the development team of any company. However, I’ve never actually distributed and operated apps.
I’m very worried about whether the project can be completed normally, but I always believe that I can do it and run toward the goal to make it so. So, We can definitely do it!
