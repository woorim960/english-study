Today, I also worked various task.
Among them, I made an appointment with CEO of 'Q-Link' to meet tomorrow at 2:00 P.M.
'Q-Link' is the company teaches students.
I think 'Q-Link' is very good company because It is doing very well in the field of lectures.
In such a company, I was proposed to work with me.

In addition, I also was proposed other companies.
One of them is the first place in IT Media field in Korean.
Its name is SBS Academy in Seohyeon Station in Bundang Gu.
Therefore, I decided to meet the SBS Academy in Monday at 6:00 P.M.

Actually, I am having hard time because My family has became economically difficult.
So I had no choice but to work.

Anyways, I decided to meet them because to earn money.
And actually, I am worrying because I think there will be too much work. The reason is that already there is a lot of work.

Even So, I think I can do it because I am perfect guy.
Anyways, Let's do well tomorrow!
