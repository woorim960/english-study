What did I do today?
I'm thinking about it... lol zzzz

well... I think I probably did  a lot of work cuz I always worked so much.
You think the same, right?

Anyways, I did various activities. The activities were carried out on the video.
This means my teammates met in the Zoom environment.
Did you understand?

After we met, we started having a meeting like always.
Ah! We each did our own work and started working on what we had to do together from 2 pm. That was about Global project tasks.

It was 4 o'clock and we finished the meeting.
Good Job!!
