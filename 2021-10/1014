Today, I worked regarding service briefing we have to announce on next Tuesday with my teammates.
I, Juhee and Sangjun became responsible for what we had to do. It was a thing that made the flow of announcement and made the important data for service briefing.

Mina became responsible for the Brochure design.
She originally was good at design.
So I didn't worry about what she does.

Also I made a script for a service briefing.
It was fantastic and very good.

I did a great job today too!
