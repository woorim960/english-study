Today, I went to the E-Lancer company to work on finance.
Actually, My teammates met on the video before go to the E-Lancer company. Because we had to finish our task regarding finances.
and then, we had to send it to Thierry mentor.

Anyways, I went to the E-Lancer company to work after finishing working with teammates.
The day was so fun.
Our meeting is getting more fun as time goes by.
The reason is that we became closer.

Our teammates always work very hard. So I think we were able to get close together.

Anyways, we carried out the works regarding finance with Thierry.
Thierry helped us so much. so I am grateful to him.
