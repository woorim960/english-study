Today, I went to the place I can scan my book and I scanned it.
My book is regarding development's refactoring. Its name is Refactoring 2 Version. After finished to scan my book, I made E-book by my scanned book. and then, I gave the E-book to my club team members. My team name is Wooahan Agile. Team members liked the E-book so much. and them said me very thank you.
So, I felt so good like them.

Currently, I am going to home cuz today is my father's birthday. At the same time, tomorrow is a worshipping day to Jesus.
So, I will play the drum at our church.
Actually, I am the drummer and Pianist. and I am also playing the other instruments in church too.

Actually, I'm in the train now.
I'm working and studying in the train cuz I have a lot of works so much.
In fact, I have to develop a API server but I'm writing the diary of today the first of all. After finished to write the diary of today, I will develop the API server cuz the developing the API server is very important.

In addition, I am sleepy so much. I think It's because is that I gave the vaccine yesterday.
Now, I wanna sleep but I can't sleep. cuz I have a lot of works.

Actually, I don't know what I have to do.
I think API server developments is very important. But I am sleepy so much So I don't know what I have to do.
However, I am knowing that I must do my works.
So I will work my tasks at my hometown.

Please cheer for me so that I can do it.
