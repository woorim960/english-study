And I wore a church uniform of Salvation Army.
It was time to go to church so I went there after finished ready.

I played a drum in church. After ended to worship, My family went to have a lunch. We ate a lot of various foods such as pasta, pizza, chicken, fried rice and salad. Ah! We ate various drinks too. Among them, I ate a orange juice I like much.

After that, My family came back to the home.
