Today, I went to Induk University because I have to work there.
I arrived there and I met my teammates.
We had a short break and then we started working at 10:10.

First of all, we took turns talking regarding each team member's Daily Scrum as always and then we discussed financial tasks.

Today, I nagged my team members for the first time because I thought we didn't respect each other.
The reason why I felt that way is because I thought when they said their opinion, they spoke in a way that ignored other people's opinions.
But fortunately, they took my nagging seriously and understood it.
So, I am grateful to them.

After lunch, Thierry mentor came back to us.
It was really nice to see him.
I think that time was probably 1 o'clock.

We started jobs regarding the presentation for brochure briefing.
First of all, Juhee and Jiwon announced the brochure in English.
Thierry reviewed the presentation of them.
He let us know what was wrong and we fixed the script for the brochure briefing.

After that, we started financial tasks.
Thierry told us we have to make a financial planning reference for the future.
We understood it and said we will complete it by the day after tomorrow.

It was 4 o'clock and we had a business meeting with various start-ups.
Also, we had a meeting with Sandy of China start-up at 5 o'clock.

I am happy because we completed all of our schedules well today too.
