Today, I went to hospital in '경희' University to get a vaccine.
At first, I had worried if vaccine hurts but it was a unnecessary concern.
After that, I went to home to work my task.
and then, I started my task. It was the server development.
First of all, I proceeded the API server development regarding Mobile main-view.
It wasn't as difficult as I thought.

In addition, Tomorrow is my father's birthday. So, I have to go to '대전' to celebrate his birthday.
Actually, I have a lot of tasks.
Therefore, I have a lot of worries if I can do it but I am thinking I can do it all of my tasks.
I am always thinking everyday I can do it well.
Fighting today too!!
