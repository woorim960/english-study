Today, I met my teammates at Induk University.
It was because today's working place was Induk University.

It had been a really long time since we met at Induk University on Tuesday.
It was because we originally always met at the E-Lancer company on Tuesday.

Anyways, we started having a meeting regarding a team project.
First of all, we took turns talking about our Scrum and Sprint.
After that, we each started working.

Originally, what we had to do today was to analyze the Judge's feedback.
But we already finished so we didn't have to do it.

After 1pm, all of the global team members gathered in one place.
and then, we recalled how we worked over the past month.
and we discussed it for each team.

After discussing each team, It was 2 o'clock and we entered each team room.
and then, we discussed with mentors.

Anyways, Thierry mentor is best!!
