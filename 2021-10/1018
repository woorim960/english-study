Today, we finished making the brochure.
Actually, It was Ms.Mina-Lee who designed the brochure.

Sangjun, Juhee and I planned how we had to do the presentation.
And then, we explained to Ms.Mina-Lee how she had to design the brochure. So, we were able to make the brochure.

After I finished making the brochure, I let Ms.Mina-Lee know what she had to fix among the wrong English translations she worked on.
Of course, I am not perfect too, but I just had known what was more right.
Anyways, after I let her know what to fix, She fixed the wrong sentences.

After lunch, We worked on the PnP ToDoList.
Among them, first we worked the AF tasks.

Ah! And then, I applied for a virtual loan $ 100,000.
It was 4 o'clock and I went to the nearby Pangyo Station because I had a meeting with a company's CEO who proposed that I become a development instructor.

It was hard today too because I had to work so much.
However, I can do it all.
