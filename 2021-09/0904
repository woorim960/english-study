Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about baseball.

I love watching baseball game.

I like to play baseball but I’m not that good.

So, I usually go to a stadium to watch baseball game on the weekend.

There is a stadium called the 잠실 Stadium in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

Oh! For your information, My favorite baseball player is 류현진.

So, I’m a big fan of LA Dodgers.

Watching base ball is very fun and exciting.

(and...) if you don’t know baseball well, I let you know the rules.

To play baseball, it needs a baseball, bats, gloves and players.

Also, they need 9 players in each team.

To win the game, they have to make more points than the other.

If I have a chance, I wanna watch the game again.

This is about baseball.
