Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my domestic trip when I was young.

I visited Jeju Island during my summer vacation when I was a child.

Jeju Island was very beautiful.

There were a lot of things to see.

First of all, there was a beautiful beach called the 중문.

I loved to walk along the beach with my family.

Also, I liked swimming at the beach.

It was very fun and exciting.

Second, I ate local food.

Jeju Island is famous for seafood.

Especially, I loved seafood barbeque.

It was very delicious because it was served fresh.

If I have a chance, I wanna go there again.

This is about my domestic trip when I was young.
