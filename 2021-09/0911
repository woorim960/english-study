Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my last internatinal trip.

2 years ago, I visited Hawaii during my summer vacation.

Hawaii was very beautiful.

There were a lot of things to see.

First of all, there was a beautiful beach called the Waikiki.

I loved to walk along the beach with my family.

Also, I liked swimming at the beach.

It was very fun and exciting.

Second, I ate local food.

Hawaii is famous for tropical fruits.

Especially, I loved coconut juice.

It was very delicious because it was served fresh.

If I have a chance, I wanna go there again.

This is about my last international trip.
