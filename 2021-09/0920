Hello, I’m Woorim-Park, CEO of Wooahan Agile, who is developing second-hand goods trading services only for students.

Our concerns began with students.
Students are always in a lot of worries.
“Should I pay 30 dollars for a textbook that I only use for one semester?”
“Should I pay 20 dollars for an engineering calculator that I only use for one semester?”
“How can I dispose of school uniforms that I don’t wear anymore?”
“Is there an easy way to get a conceptual summary note containing the know-how of the seniors?”

Everyone had this concern when they were in school.

Therefore, we used to throw away things that we used as students or give them to someone.

In fact, the second-hand goods trading market grew very significantly from 2008 to 2020, from 4 trillion to 20 trillion.

As a result, a wide variety of second-hand goods trading and communication services have emerged and are currently actively operated.

Nevertheless,

Not only are students unable to trade the goods they want, but they are also unable to communicate with various students.

Actually,

Looking at the customer usage statistics of Carrot Market, which has the largest number of customers in Korea.
It can be seen that 10s and 20s are quite low.
It’s because there’s no item in the market that students want.
So I asked the students.

If there is a second-hand goods trading service only for students, will you use it?
Surprisingly, 75% of students answered that they use it.
Why is that?
This is because the person who understands the student best is the student.

School Barter is a second-hand goods trading platform only for students created for these students.
What should we do for them?

9p
---
It’s about attracting not only university students but also high school students so that they can trade and communicate with various students.
This will allow students to interact with students from other schools as well as their own schools, unlike other existing platforms.

10p
---
We will provide a pre-certification solution so that only students can use the School Barter.
As a result, students will be trusted with the School Barter.

11p
---
We will provide optimized categories only for students, such as schools/majors/grades.

12p
---
In addition, we will provide an English version application for foreign students.
This also means that we are planning to enter the global market.

Can this be possible? 

13p
---
Surprisingly, so many students were positive about the second-hand goods trading and communication platform only for students.

14p
---
Even targeting just high school and university students, it can be seen that there are 4 million customers.
We will target and establish a small niche market called the second-hand goods trading only for students and grow fast.

Our team is growing really fast thanks to its fast execution and verification.
Just one day after the team members were formed, each team member’s abilities were verified and analyzed to assign optimized jobs.
