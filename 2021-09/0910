# 답변

Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about the food I eat on a trip.

I love trying local food.

It’s such a new experience to me.

2 years ago, I visited Hawaii during my summer vacation.

I loved to eat seafood barbeque and coconut juice in Hawaii.

These are the most famous Hawaiian dishes.

When I tasted it first, Wow! It was amazing.

They were served fresh and so delicious.

Once you taste them, You’ll never forget the flavors.

I can’t forget the day.

If I have a chance, I wanna go there again.

This is about the food I eat on a trip.
