Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my plans for a domestic trip.

I like to go on a trip because it’s very fun and exciting.

There are several things I consider.

First of all, I consider the place where I stay at.

I usually stay at the Hilton Hotel because they offer great service.

Second, I make plans in detail where to visit.

It can save my time.

Lastly, I don’t like to carry big luggage.

So, I usually pack lightly.

It’s very convenient and useful.

This is about what I plan for a domestic trip.
