1. I visit New York, USA often for my vacations.

Ask me three or four questions about that place in order to find out whether you want to spend a vacation there too.

Hello, Eva. This is woorim park.

How’s everything?

I heard that you also like to go on a trip just like I do.

Oh! And you told me you like to visit New York for a vacation.

So, I have a few questions about New York.

Do you mind?

First of all, what kind of food do they eat?

In my case, I’ve tried Shake Shack burger and it was amazing.

And... Can you tell me any famous tourist attractions?

I went the Empire State Building and Central Park.

What else... Oh!

Is there any place to shop?

I heard that there is a famous shopping place called 5th Avenue.

Thank you very much.

If I have a chance, I wanna go there with you.

Call me up~ Bye!
