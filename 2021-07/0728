Wow, this is a very interesting question.

I’d like to talk about my memorable music experience.

I usually go to the concert hall called Seoul Art Center in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

Last weekend, I went to the concert hall for watching PSY with my friends.

As you might know, My favorite singer is PSY.

Also, he is very famous in Korea.

I like his song ‘Gangnam Style’.

We enjoyed it together.

While I was watching his concert,

I met my ex-girlfriend.

so, I was stunned and surprised because she was my first love.

She was looking good.

We noticed each other and smiled, I hope she’ll be happy.

I can’t forget the day.

This is about my memorable experience regarding music.
