Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my neighbors.

I live in an apartment.

Recently, my new neighbors moved in my building.

There are 3 people in my neighbor’s family; a couple and one child.

They are lovely family.

At the first time, I had a good impression.

I wanted to get along with them.

They moved in next door.

So, I invited them to my home.

We talked a lot and shared many things.

We enjoyed it together.

They are very kind and nice ⭐️.

Every time I see them on the hall way,

We say hello to each other.

I’m happy to have new neighbors.
