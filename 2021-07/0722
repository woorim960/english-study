답변

Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about the concert hall / theater.


There is a concert hall / theater called Seoul Art Center in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

I usually go to there on the weekend.


There are several things I can see.

First of all, there are staffs.

They are well-dressed with black and white uniforms.

They are very kind and nice.

Whenever I visit there, they offer great service.


Second, there is a parking lot.

It’s big so it’s easy to park my car.

Actually, I’m not a good driver so I need enough space to park my car.


Also, Seoul Art Center has amazing sound system.

The sound system is very good.

So, I think I get more excited when I watch a concert / performance at the concert hall / theater.

In addition, seats are very comfortable.

If I have a chance, I wanna go there again.


This is about the concert hall / theater (I usually go to).
