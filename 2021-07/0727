답변

Wow, this is a very interesting question.

I’d like to talk about the music (I like).


My favorite music is K-POP.

Also, K-POP is the most popular genre(music style) in Korea.

I like listening to music by my smartphone.

It’s very convenient and useful.

In addition, I listen to music on the weekend when I have free time.

It relives my stress.


(and...)

Oh! My favorite singer is PSY.

Do you know him?

He is very famous in Korea.

I like his song ‘Gangnam Style’.

This song is very fun and exciting.

If you haven’t heard this song, try listening to it.

You’re gonna like it very much.


Anyways, this is about the music I like.
