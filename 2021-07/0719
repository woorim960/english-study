답변

Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my memorable experience at the movie theater.

I usually go to the movie theater called CGV in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.


Last weekend, I went to the movie theater for watching movie with my friends.

As you might know, My favorite hobby is watching movie.

It’s very fun and exciting.

We enjoyed it together.


Anyways, I was trying to find my credit card to pay the ticket, (oh my god)

I realized that I lost my wallet.

So, I looked for it everywhere, But I couldn’t find it.

I was so depressed because I needed my credit card to purchase.

Fortunately, my wallet was at my home.

I learned that I should be more careful.

I can’t forget the day.


This is all about my memorable experience at the movie theater.
