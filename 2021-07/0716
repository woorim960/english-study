Wow, This is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my memorable experience at the concert hall.

I usually go to a concert hall called the Seoul Art Center in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.


Last weekend, I went to a Concert hall to watch PSY with my friends.
