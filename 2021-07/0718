Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about the movie theater.


There is a movie theater called CGV in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

I usually go to there on the weekend.


There are several things I can see.

First of all, there are staffs.

They are well-dressed with black and white uniforms.

They are very kind and nice.

Whenever I visit there, they offer great service.


Second, there is a parking lot.

It’s big so it’s easy to park my car.

Actually, I’m not a good driver so I need enough space to park my car.


Also, there is a big snack bar in the movie theater.

They sell popcorns, coke, nacho, chips and juice.

I love to drink lemonade while I watch movie.

I really like it very much.

If I have a chance, I wanna go there again.


This is about the movie theater (I usually go to).
