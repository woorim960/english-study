I like to read books, too.

Ask me three to four questions in order to find out my favorite author.


답변

Hello, Eva. This is woorim park.

How’s everything? (= How’s going = How are you doing).

I heard that you also like to read books just like I do.

So, I have a few questions about reading books.

Do you mind?

First of all, what kind of book do you like?

In my case, I like fantazy novels the most.

And... When do you usually read books?

I usually read books on the weekend because I’m very busy working.

What else... Oh!

Where do you go to read books?

I go to the city library in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

Lastly, I have one more question.

What is your favorite book?

and who is your favorite author?

My favorite book is Harry Potter.

So, I like J.K Rowling very much.

Thank you very much.

I’m happy to get to know you.

Bye~
