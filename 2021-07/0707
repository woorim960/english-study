Wow, this is a very interesting question.

I’d love to talk about my home.

Actually, the question you just asked me,

I don’t have that kind of experience in my entire life.

(cuz...) I’ve never moved out.

I’ve lived in my apartment for 20 years.

Sorry for not sharing any specific memories.

So, if you don’t mind, I really wanna share about my current home.

My apartment is 20 stories building.

I live on the 7th floor.

My home has 4 badrooms, one big living room, and 2 bathrooms.

Also, there’s a clean and white kitchen.

​

My favorite space in my home is living room,

because I love spending time with my family.

In addition, I watch TV programs with them.

It’s very fun and exciting.

​

However, I’m very busy working

so I spend my free time on the weekend.

This is about my home.

Thank you for listening.
