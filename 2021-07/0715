Wow, This is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my memorable experience at 장소(=주제).

I usually go to 장소(=주제) in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

Last weekend, I went to 장소 to 목적(~하러) with my friends.

그 장소에 해당되는 개별 스크립트 2~3줄

Anyways, I was trying to find my credit card to pay my stuff, (oh my god)

I realized that I lost my wallet.

So, I looked for it everywhere. but I couldn’t find it.

I was so depressed because I needed my wallet and card.

Fortunately, my wallet was at home.

I learned that I should be more careful.

I can’t forget the day.

This is all about my memorable experience at the 장소(=주제).
