Wow, This is a very interesting question.

I’d like to talk about my neighborhood.


I live in 잠실 in Seoul.

My town is very nice to live.


There are several things I can see.

First of all, there is Olympic park.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.


Also, there is a jogging track at the park.

I like to go jogging and running.

It’s good for my health.

Plus, it relieves my stress.


Second, there is a movie theater called CGV.

I usually go there on the weekend.

because I’m very busy working.
